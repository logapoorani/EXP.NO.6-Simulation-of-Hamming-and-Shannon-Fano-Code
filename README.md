# AIM
```
To study and verify the simulation of Huffman and Shannon-Fano Code.
```

# SOFTWARE REQUIRED

# ALGORITHMS

Step 1: Initialization
Initialize:

L = 0 (to store average codeword length)

hs = 0 (to store entropy)

p[] = empty list to store probabilities

lk[] = empty list to store codeword lengths

var = 0 (to store variance)

Step 2: Input
Input number of samples n.

For each sample from 1 to n:

Input the probability p[i], append to list p.

For each sample from 1 to n:

Input the codeword length lk[i], append to list lk.

Step 3: Calculate Average Codeword Length (L)
For each symbol i from 0 to n-1:

Multiply p[i] * lk[i] and add to L.

Step 4: Calculate Entropy (hs)
For each symbol i from 0 to n-1:

Compute p[i] * log₂(1 / p[i]) and add to hs.

Round entropy hs to 3 decimal places.

Step 5: Calculate Efficiency (eff)
Compute eff = hs / L.

Round eff to 3 decimal places.

Step 6: Calculate Redundancy (red)
Compute red = 1 - eff.

Round red to 3 decimal places.

Step 7: Calculate Variance (var)
For each symbol i from 0 to n-1:

Compute p[i] * (lk[i] - L)² and add to var.

Round var to 3 decimal places.

Step 8: Output Results
Print:

Average Codeword Length L

Entropy hs

Efficiency eff

Redundancy red

Variance var
